Generating SSH Key For Github Account :

1. Generate SSH Key
	->ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
	  The above command will prompt you to enter file name to save ssh keys

	- > Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_algorithm):[Press enter]
		ex: recipe_api_project
		
	-> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
	   ex: Welcome@123
	   
	 -> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
		ex: Welcome@123
	
2.  Add ssh Key to the ssh-agent
	Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key. 
	eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
	it will provide you pid
	-> Ensure the ssh-agent is running. You can use the "Auto-launching the ssh-agent" instructions in "Working with SSH key passphrases", or start it manually:
	# start the ssh-agent in the background
	eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
	it will provide you pid
	
	-> Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.
	
	ex: ssh-add ~/.ssh/recipe_api_project
	
3. Add the ssh key to your github account
   Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.
   clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   and add to ssh key section in your github account
