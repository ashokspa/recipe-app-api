1. Create Docker Access Toekn and Add it to the git secrets : (SECTION 1)
	DOCKERHUB_USER
		tashok
	DOCKERHUB_TOKEN
		dckr_pat_Dv6Idp0TgsZo4GgQRjJVf8vid9c

2. Generating SSH Key For Github Account : (SECTION 2)
   Another source : https://linuxkamarada.com/en/2019/07/14/using-git-with-ssh-keys/#.YwoEmxxBy3A

	1. Generate SSH Key
		->ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
		The above command will prompt you to enter file name to save ssh keys

		- > Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_algorithm):[Press enter]
			ex: recipe_api_project
			
		-> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
		ex: Welcome@123
		
		-> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
			ex: Welcome@123
		
	2.  Add ssh Key to the ssh-agent
		Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key. 
		eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
		it will provide you pid
		-> Ensure the ssh-agent is running. You can use the "Auto-launching the ssh-agent" instructions in "Working with SSH key passphrases", or start it manually:
		# start the ssh-agent in the background
		eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
		it will provide you pid
		
		-> Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.
		
		ex: ssh-add ~/.ssh/recipe_api_project
		
	3. Add the ssh key to your github account
	Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.
	clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
	and add to ssh key section in your github account
	
3. Git User Configuration : (SECTION 3)

	if you wants to use ssh keys please follow the : SECTION 3
	and configure remote origin 
		ex: git remote add origin git@github.com:ashokspa/recipe-app-api.git


	if you wants to use https we need to configure in the below format

		git config --local user.name "Ashok Thangellapally"
		git config --local user.email "tashok.503@gmail.com"
	
	if you face any issues while pushing using local configuration use this command
	
		git config --local credential.helper ""	
		add remote repositer using the below command if not crated already:
			git remote add origin https://github.com/ashokspa/recipe-app-api.git
			
4.  Project Setup :
    
	1. Create docker file for project set.
		docker file contains 
		  -> python alpine image 
		  -> python virtual environment
		  -> python requirement.txt file
		  -> copy requirement.txt file from local source to application folder
		  -> copy local application folder to the container
		  -> Expose port numbers
		  -> create user for docker container image os
		  
	2. Build docker image using the docker file
		-> docker built --tag imageName .
		which builds docker image using the configuration defined in the Dockerfile
		
	3. Create docker-compose.yml file 
	   docker-compose proides configuration parameters to run the docker application container
	   ex; setting port numbers
		   builds image and attach it to the contianer
		   
5. Configuring linting and testing to the apllication.
		   
	Linting highlights syntactical and stylistic problems in your Python source code, which often helps you identify and correct subtle programming errors or unconventional coding practices that can lead to errors
	
	
	inorder to use linting we need to configure:	
	
	1. We use flake8 libray for python linting, this is a development dependancy so we keep this flake8 in requirement.dev.txt file
	so that we can use flake8 for linting only in development version
	
	2. set requirement.dev.txt in docker file so that only development dependencis will be installed
	when we use the application in development mode
	
	3. Configure .flake8 configuration file which which contains settings related to flaker libray
	   for ex: if we want to exclude few files which needs to be excluded form linting then we can configure them in the .flake8 configuration file
	   
	4. Finally run the linting tool by using docker-compose
	   ex: docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "flake8" 
	   
	
6. Initial Setup and Test

	1. docker-compose build
	2. docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "flake8"
	3. docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "django-admin startproject app ."
	4. docker-compose up

	Sample Unit Test Execution

	  Unit test cases can be written in different ways
	  1. Creating tests module in Application folder
		We can write test cases directly in Django application folder and test module name should be tests.py
	  2. Creating test modules in seperate folder for each application.
		 If we wants to create test modules in seperate folder we need to create __init__.py file inorder to identify this folder as package
		 and every test moule should be started with "test_"
		  ex: test_first_module
			  test_second_module
			  
	  Ex:
		For this example we are creating tests.py file in app folder as it is the deafult application for our current project
		1. calc.py
		2. tests.py
		
		basically calc.py file containes calculator function which adds two numbers and returns the value
		where as tests.py file contains test code where it check the add function written in calc.py file
		
		calc.py
		"""
		Calculator function
		"""
		
		def add(x,y):
		""" Add x, y and return the result """
			return x+y
			
			
		docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "python manage.py test"
		
8. Configure Database
   once database service has been configured in docker-compose.yml we can start the service by using
	- docker-compose up
