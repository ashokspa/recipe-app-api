Sample Unit Test Execution

  Unit test cases can be written in different ways
  1. Creating tests module in Application folder
	We can write test cases directly in Django application folder and test module name should be tests.py
  2. Creating test modules in seperate folder for each application.
	 If we wants to create test modules in seperate folder we need to create __init__.py file inorder to identify this folder as package
	 and every test moule should be started with "test_"
	  ex: test_first_module
	      test_second_module
		  
  Ex:
	For this example we are creating tests.py file in app folder as it is the deafult application for our current project
	1. calc.py
	2. tests.py
	
	basically calc.py file containes calculator function which adds two numbers and returns the value
	where as tests.py file contains test code where it check the add function written in calc.py file
	
	calc.py
	"""
	Calculator function
	"""
	
	def add(x,y):
	""" Add x, y and return the result """
		return x+y
